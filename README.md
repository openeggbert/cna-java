# CNA-Java

CNA-Java is an early, measured Java 17 projection of Microsoft XNA Framework
4.0 backed by CNA C++ through CNA's stable C ABI and a JNI adapter.

## Honest status

The **complete XNA 4.0 runtime superset** is structurally at zero diagnostics. That means every
formally mapped type and member matches the ten original, SHA-256-pinned Microsoft runtime
assemblies. It does not mean every runtime capability is present; the capability inventory and
`NEXT.md` record what is not.

```text
Selected Windows runtime profile (7 assemblies)
XNA reference:        257 types / 2,964 members
Mapped Java contract: 265 types / 3,242 members
Total diagnostics:      0

Full runtime superset (10 assemblies, adding GamerServices, Net and Avatar)
XNA reference:        331 types / 3,640 members
Mapped Java contract: 340 types / 4,022 members
Java target:          340 types / 4,022 members
Missing types:          0
Missing members:        0
Total diagnostics:      0
Allowlist:              0
Strict leaks:           0
```

The narrower profile is a subset gate: a type the wider profile declares is not an unexpected
type in it. The exact breakdown is in [plan.md](plan.md) and [NEXT.md](NEXT.md).

Implemented now:

- normative CLR-to-Java mapping, foundational math/framework types, the `Game`
  lifecycle/component/service/window surface, and deterministic ownership;
- native keyboard, mouse, gamepad, raw touch, and gesture paths, with
  `FrameworkDispatcher.Update` pumping CNA framework services;
- the graphics device, state, texture/render-target, vertex/index declaration
  and buffer families, including dynamic uploads, ContentLost callbacks, draw
  routes, and the safety guard around CNA's bound-buffer lifetime defect;
- texture-based and string-based `SpriteBatch` contracts, including complete
  Begin state/effect overloads, plus native SpriteFont measurement/drawing for
  fonts obtained from the existing CNA loader;
- real Effect bytecode/reflection, stable technique/pass/parameter/annotation
  views, real pass application, and all five executable native stock effects:
  `BasicEffect`, `AlphaTestEffect`, `DualTextureEffect`,
  `EnvironmentMapEffect`, and `SkinnedEffect`;
- a managed Windows XNB version-5 reader foundation with reader tables, custom
  and primitive/value readers, shared resources, external references, cache
  identity, existing-instance handling, partial-failure cleanup, and real
  Texture2D, SpriteFont, vertex/index buffer, Effect/BasicEffect, and Model
  built-in readers;
- exact managed XNA LZX compressed-XNB framing with stateful multi-frame
  decoding, strict length/trailing-data checks, failure cleanup, cache identity,
  and the existing Texture2D reader verified through both compressed and
  uncompressed framing;
- the complete selected-profile Model object graph, including stable read-only
  collection identities and real indexed drawing through loaded CNA resources;
- the complete 19-type Audio/XACT contract, including native SoundEffect,
  SoundEffectInstance, dynamic streaming/callbacks, honest NULL-microphone
  behavior, and an ownership-correct XACT graph whose authored-bank playback is
  explicitly asset-pending;
- the complete 24-type Media/Video contract, including native platform-library
  collections, owned URI songs, process-global MediaPlayer/queue/event routes,
  Video XNB metadata, native VideoPlayer controls, and an explicitly borrowed
  transient frame facade whose stronger XNA identity remains backend-blocked;
- the complete three-type Storage contract, including authoritative completed-result
  `Begin`/`End` behavior, native container/stream CRUD, process-global device events,
  reverse Game ownership, and explicit Java containment for a documented CNA path gap;
- all 13 Design converters as a managed Java conversion subsystem, with an explicit compact
  TypeConverter language mapping, XNA-ordered property decomposition, constructor reconstruction,
  and culture-aware integer, byte, and binary32 text behavior;
- the complete `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GamerServices` and
  `Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Net` families, including the Avatar types: gamers, the
  signed-in roster, achievements, friends, profiles, privileges, game defaults,
  presence, the Guide, leaderboards, the property dictionary, sessions,
  discovery, rosters, machines and packets, all reaching real CNA routes;
- four CNA extension families outside the strict packages --
  `org.openeggbert.cna.extensions.graphics`, `.runtime`, `.devices` and
  `.input` -- covering the extended graphics layer, the runtime's own identity
  and logger, the host device capabilities, and typed text with mouse cursors,
  each preserving `NOT_SUPPORTED` as its own answer rather than downgrading;
- a Java 17 JNI adapter for 1,225 CNA ABI 0.20.0 routes whose dispatch-table
  slots are declared from the headers themselves, so a signature that moves
  upstream stops the adapter compiling; the mechanical half of that boundary is
  generated from the headers and checked for staleness by the build;
- a classification for every one of the 4,051 canonical CNA C API functions,
  with zero unexplained, derived from the JNI call graph and the Java sources,
  and with every bound route reached from Java;
- managed and native integration/ownership tests plus a desktop template canary
  verified for 60-frame smoke and 600-frame stability runs using both raw PNG
  and managed Texture2D XNB paths.

The current managed XNB implementation supports uncompressed and XNA LZX-
compressed Windows framing.
Texture2D upload is fidelity-preserving for `SurfaceFormat.Color`; all other
surface formats are rejected until CNA can create/upload the exact format, and
compressed data is never reinterpreted as RGBA. SpriteFont is consequently
verified with an uncompressed Color atlas. The Model path is verified for a
synthetic graph using VertexDeclaration, VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer, and
BasicEffect readers; reader families not in that graph remain explicit load
errors. Graphics, Audio/XACT, Media/Video, Storage, Design, GamerServices, Avatar and Net
are all at zero missing types. Remaining runtime boundaries are kept separately in the
machine-readable capability inventory rather than hidden by the strict score.

## Build and verify

Use the pinned Gradle 8.12 Wrapper with JDK 17 or newer. CNA headers come from
`CNA_ROOT`, or from the sibling `../../cnanext` checkout. There is deliberately
no fallback to another CNA checkout: qualifying against one would make every
ABI, symbol and layout result describe a library nobody ships.

```bash
./gradlew clean check
```

The normal build compiles with `--release 17`, retained parameter names,
`-Xlint:all`, and `-Werror`. Native integration tests are enabled when
`CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY` points at a compatible CNA C ABI library. The JNI adapter
can be overridden with `CNA_JNI_LIBRARY`.

```bash
CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY=/path/to/libcna_c_api.so ./gradlew clean check
```

Run the report-only API measurement with the legally available original XNA 4.0
assemblies:

```bash
XNA_REFERENCE_DIR=/path/to/xna4 ./gradlew apiCompatReport      # selected profile
XNA_REFERENCE_DIR=/path/to/xna4 ./gradlew apiCompatFullReport  # full superset
```

`apiCompatCheck` and `apiCompatFullCheck` are the completeness gates; both pass at
zero diagnostics.
The leak guard and native ABI shape checks remain part of the green `check` gate.

To verify this binding, the sibling template, and a freshly generated external
project without touching the global Maven repository:

```bash
scripts/verify-template.sh
```

Set `CNA_NATIVE_LIBRARY` to add the 60-frame runtime smoke. Also set
`CNA_RUN_STABILITY_TEST=1` to add the 600-frame run.

## Public API policy

`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.*` is reserved for the strict XNA Java projection.
Its public/protected signatures may not expose native handles or
`org.openeggbert.cna.internal.*`. Future opt-in CNA-specific functionality
belongs under `org.openeggbert.cna.extensions.*` (or a real native CNA concept),
not in the strict packages.

## Platform evidence

Only Linux x86-64 with CNA HEADLESS platform, HEADLESS renderer and NULL audio,
built from the sibling `cnanext` against the sibling `sharp-runtimenext`, has
runtime evidence in this checkout. Windows and macOS desktop are planned. Android is planned but has no
backend/package. iOS and browser targets are unsupported. Java source
portability is not native runtime evidence.
