 * give that effect a value to work with.

 * nothing but a uniform is the shortest path from a Java call to a colour on a render target: set
 * the uniform, draw, read the target back, and the colour is either the one that was set or the
 * uniform never arrived. Nothing weaker distinguishes a binding that works from one that returns
 * {@code SUCCESS} and does nothing, which is what every earlier test of this layer could say.
