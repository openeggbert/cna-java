 * One thing a renderer can or cannot do.

 * <p>A CNA extension. XNA answers a fixed set of these through {@code GraphicsProfile}, which
 * describes a <em>tier</em> rather than a renderer: Reach and HiDef were chosen for the hardware
 * of 2010, and a game asking whether it may dispatch a compute shader today has nowhere in XNA to
 * ask. CNA answers each capability separately, and this is that question.
 *
 * <p>The constant order is CNA's own, because the C API identifies a capability by ordinal, and
 * {@link RendererCapabilities} is where they are asked.
