/**
 * What an effect is made of, asked of any effect rather than only of one this binding built.
 *
 * <p>A CNA extension. XNA's {@code Effect} tells a game nothing about itself beyond its parameters
 * and techniques: whether it came from compiled bytecode or from source, whether a renderer is
 * behind it at all, and what its source says are all invisible. CNA answers all three, and on a
 * renderer that compiles shaders the answers are worth having -- a shader-editing tool needs the
 * source it is editing, and a game whose effect draws nothing needs to know whether there is a
 * program behind it.
 *
 * <p>Static, because these are questions <em>about</em> an XNA type rather than members of it: an
 * {@code Effect} lives in {@code Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics} and nothing CNA-specific may
 * appear on it. That is the same arrangement {@link EffectLighting} already uses.
