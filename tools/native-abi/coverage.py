"""Classifies every canonical CNA C API function for CNA-Java.

The goal is not to bind every C function.  Many are pure value math CNA-Java
performs in Java, and many are C-only conveniences.  The goal is that **no
canonical function is unexplained**: each one is either reached from Java --
and the report says from which public surface -- or carries an explicit rule
saying why it is not.

For a bound function the classification is *derived*, never declared:

1. the JNI adapter is parsed into its top-level C functions and a call graph,
   so each ``Java_org_openeggbert_cna_internal_*`` entry point resolves to the
   transitive set of ``cna.<slot>`` routes it can reach;
2. the Java sources are parsed for ``native`` declarations and their call
   sites, so each route resolves to the set of Java packages that reach it;
3. a route reached from ``Microsoft.Xna.Framework.*`` is ``XNA_BACKING``, one
   reached only from ``org.openeggbert.cna.extensions.*`` is a bound CNA
   extension, and one reached only from internal plumbing is
   ``JAVA_INTERNAL_ONLY``.

For an unbound function ``coverage-rules.json`` supplies the classification and
the exact reason.  Anything no rule matches is ``UNMAPPED_REQUIRES_REVIEW``,
which ``--check`` treats as a failure.

Purpose and binding status are two independent questions and are two independent
fields.  ``classification`` answers *why the route exists for CNA-Java* -- whether
it backs XNA, extends it, is internal plumbing or has no Java meaning -- and
``purposeReason`` says it in prose.  ``bindingStatus`` answers the separate
question *why the route is not bound*, from a closed set, and ``bindingReason``
says it in prose with ``evidence`` naming the measurement behind it.

The two were one overloaded field until this session, and the cost was concrete:
a hundred and twenty-eight routes carried text explaining why they were a CNA
extension rather than XNA, which reads like an explanation and answers a
question nobody asked about binding.  A rule that supplies only a purpose is now
a gate failure, not a silent pass.
