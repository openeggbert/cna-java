"""Generates the JNI adapter and Java declarations for scalar CNA C API routes.

The native boundary is large and CNA is still evolving, so the mechanical part
of it is generated from the live headers instead of hand-written.  A route
listed in ``routes.json`` names only its Java class, its Java method name and
its CNA symbol; every JNI type, every marshalling step and the Java ``native``
declaration are derived from that symbol's declaration in ``CNA/C/*.h``.

What is generated is only the *boundary*.  The public Java API is a semantic
XNA/CNA facade written by hand; nothing here produces public API.

Supported parameter shapes, all derived from the header:

``value``     a scalar, identity or handle passed by value
``out``       a scalar, identity or handle out-parameter (its C name starts
              with ``out_``), projected as a one-element Java array
``string``    a ``CNA_StringView`` input, projected as a UTF-8 ``byte[]``
``text``      the ``char* buffer, uint64_t capacity, uint64_t* out_written``
              triple CNA uses for a copy-out string, projected as one
              ``byte[]`` whose length supplies the capacity plus a ``long[]``
``struct``    a flat POD struct out-parameter, flattened to its scalar leaves
              and projected as a ``long[]`` and/or a ``float[]``

A route whose declaration uses anything else -- a callback, a ``void*``
context, an array of structs -- is refused with a diagnostic rather than
guessed at, and stays hand-written.

A bare ``T*`` is one structure or an array of them and C does not say which, so
the generator reads the parameter's own documentation: one that names a count is
refused until ``routes.json`` says what it is.  ``arrayLengths`` gives the
element count; ``singleStructs`` says the count in the prose is the structure's
own fields rather than a number of structures.
